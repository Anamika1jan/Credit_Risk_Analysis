**ðŸ”¹ 4. Business Insights
**
Credit Score vs Default Risk

Low credit scores strongly correlate with high default risk.

Employment Stability Matters

Unemployed and self-employed clients have higher rejection and default rates.

Education Level Impact

Higher education levels show better loan approval rates.

Overdue & Late Payments

Clients with repeated late payments and overdue amounts are more likely to fall in the "High Risk" category.

ðŸ”¹ 5. Recommendations

Prioritize loan approvals for clients with stable jobs, good credit scores, and no overdue history.

Implement stricter checks for clients with multiple previous loans & high overdue balances.

Consider financial literacy programs for high-risk clients with low education levels.
